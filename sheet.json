This is a first pass, and is subject to change following playtesting.\r\r**Important:** For the rolls to work properly, follow the instructions for setting up custom rollable tables for The One Ring, with the caveat that instead of `normal`, it should be called `0` and instead of `weary` it should be called `1`. The reason for this, is that Weary is a checkbox on the sheet, and the rolls use the value of the checkbox to look up the correct table to roll on (and while checkboxes can have a string for their 'on' state, 'off' is always 0)."
