# The One Ring Character Sheet for Roll20

The roll buttons assume you have a number of rollable tables (`feat`, `lm-feat`, `normal` and `weary`) setup, as described on [the Roll20 Wiki page for The One Ring](https://wiki.roll20.net/The_One_Ring).

This is in fact three character sheets in one. A full-on Player Character sheet and two Loremaster sheets meant for characters (that is people who are on the side of the players) and adversaries (that is characters who are not, or creatures). Two two former use the `feat` table for rolls, and the latter uses the `lm-feat` table (and has Hate instead of Hope).
